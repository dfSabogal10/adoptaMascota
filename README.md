A new way to help you little friends to find a lovely family, when you rescue or find a pet without home, we give you the tool to publish his information and also we give your contact info for those who want to give them a home.

For facebook login you have to replace the following elements in main.js:

appId: 'YOUR_TEST_APP_ID',
secret: 'YOUR_TEST_APP_SECRET'

Then, the project is created in meteor, for deploying run the following commands:

meteor npm install
meteor npm start

For default it is using the mongoDB present in meteor.
